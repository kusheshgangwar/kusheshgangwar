## Selected Data Projects

### TITANIC — Passenger Survival Classification
- Goal: Demonstrate end-to-end EDA and supervised modelling to predict passenger survival.
- Work done: data cleaning, missing-value strategies, feature engineering (titles, family size), model comparison, and interpretation.
- Tech: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Deliverables: Clean notebook with visualizations, model evaluation metrics, and a short summary of actionable findings.

### HEART DISEASE — Clinical Risk Classifier
- Goal: Predict presence of heart disease using clinical attributes and provide interpretable results.
- Work done: data preprocessing, normalization, feature selection, model tuning (Logistic Regression, Random Forest), ROC/AUC evaluation, and feature importance analysis.
- Tech: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
- Deliverables: Reproducible analysis notebook, evaluation report, and recommendations for next steps.

(Full notebooks, data links, and reproducible instructions can be added to the repository — reach out if you'd like collaboration or early access.)

## How I Work
- Start with a clear question and success metrics.
- Create reproducible, well-documented notebooks and scripts.
- Produce clear visualizations and executive summaries that communicate impact.
- Version control and modularize code for reusability.
